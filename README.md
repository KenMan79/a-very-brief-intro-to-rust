## Workshop leaders

We want to keep track of where RustBridge workshops have happened! Please add
the city where you're holding the workshop to this repository in two places:

1. Add a dot to the globe in the introduction slides by editing globe.html and
   adding to the `city_data` variable the name of the city and the decimal
   latitude and longitude.
2. In the text for the 2nd slide in `intro.html`, change the ordinal number of
   the workshop that you're running if necessary, and add your workshop's city
   to the speakers notes for that slide.

Then send a pull request to this repo so that future workshops know about you!!
