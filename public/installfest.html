## Installfest!

* Goal: to make sure your computer is ready to go for tomorrow.
* You will install Rust and run a few more commands that will test what we need to have working.
* We will explain what all these commands do tomorrow!
* If at any point you get error messages or unexpected output, call someone over for help!

## Install Rust

The best way to install Rust is with [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). rustup
is a Rust version manager. To install it type:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

and follow any other instructions.

## Check your installation

You should be able to run these two commands and get the same output:

```
rustc --version
rustc 1.12.0 (3191fbae9 2016-09-23)
```

and

```
cargo --version
cargo 0.13.0-nightly (109cb7c 2016-08-19)
```

## Check cargo

Go into a directory where you keep code and run:

```
cargo new --bin installtest
cd installtest
cargo run
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling installtest v0.1.0 (file:///projects/installtest)
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.46 secs
     Running target/debug/installtest
Hello, world!
```

## Check installing crates

In your `installtest` directory, edit `Cargo.toml` and add this line to the end:

```
hyper = "0.9.10"
```

Run `cargo run` again, and you should see output that looks like this:

```no-highlight
$ cargo run
    Updating registry https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index
 Downloading gcc v0.3.37
 Downloading [... a bunch more things ...]
   Compiling typeable v0.1.2
   Compiling [... a bunch more things ...]
   Compiling installtest v0.1.0 (file:///projects/installtest)
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 32.0 secs
     Running target/debug/installtest
   Hello, world!
```

## More useful `rustup` commands

Rustup makes it easy to have different versions of Rust installed and keep them
up to date. Rust has 3 release "channels": stable, beta, and nightly. New stable and beta versions come out every six weeks.

To update all channels you have installed, use:

```
rustup update
```

To show what versions you have installed, type:

```
rustup toolchain list
```

To switch which toolchain you're currently using, for example to switch to "nightly", type:

```
rustup default nightly
```
