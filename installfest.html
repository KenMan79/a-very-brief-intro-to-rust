## Install Rust

The best way to install Rust is with [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). rustup is a Rust
version manager. To install it type:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

To keep your rust up-to-date with the latest stable version of rust,
type:

```
rustup update
```

To show what versions you have installed, type:

```
rustup toolchain list
```

To switch which toolchain you're currently using, type:

```
rustup default nightly
```

To check which version of Rust you have type:

```
rustc --version
```

- A new version comes out every 6 weeks
- Stability without stagnation
- your stuff won't break
- channels
- cool new stuff is still being added!
- experimental stuff starts nightly only

Rustup makes it easy to have different versions and stay up to date.
